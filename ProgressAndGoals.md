# Progress and Goals

## Completed Requirement
- Created an API server for a geographic database
   - Requirement completed: We have successfully implemented and added endpoints that are required for the API server to run.
- Implemented CRUD operations for the data stored in the dataset.
   - Requirement completed: Created backend code that handles the data collection for countries, cities, and states.
- Created a dozen or more endpoints
   - Requirement completed: Endpoints have been created for each element of data stored in the dataset to perform its functionality.
- Each endpoint and other functions having unit testing
   - Requirement completed: All endpoints have been tested to ensure reliability and correctness of this project.
- Each endpoint are documented for Swagger
   - Requirement completed: Provided clear documentation for future understanding and client applications.
- When practical, data should be cached in RAM
   -  Requirement completed: Optimize the performance for frequently accessed data.
- Deploy the project to the cloud using CI/CD
   - Requirement partially met: When deploying the project to the cloud, there were some challenges connecting the server to the cloud. There were changes to address the issue however, more modifications and testing needs to be done to ensure that the API server has been successfully connected to the cloud.


## Goals for Semester
-  Improve our written and oral presentation skills
   - Write a clear README that explains the overall project and continuously refine our API documentation
   - Prepare a presentation to explain the project features and the design decisions.
   - Practice presenting outside of the classroom before presenting to the class.
-  Ensure the software quality and reliability
   - Write and run the unit tests for every component of the UI and API.
   - Test continuously the integration between the UI and the API backend code.
   -  Connect the UI with the existing API endpoints to ensure accurate data is being collected.
- Enhance Performance and User Experience
   - Optimize API calls and cache frequently accessed data
   - Ensure UI features are clearly developed and include signifiers and feedback for user actions.
   - Implement usability testing to identify and fix any design issues.
