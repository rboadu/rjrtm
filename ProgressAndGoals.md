# Progress and Goals

## Completed Requirement
- Created an API server for a geographic database
   - Requirement completed: Successfully implemented a RESTful API server to manage geographic data, including countries, states, and cities.
   - All required endpoints are functional and integrated into the server.
- Implemented CRUD operations for the data stored in the dataset.
   - Requirement completed: Created backend code that handles the data collection for countries, cities, and states.
   - Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all core data models.
- Created a dozen or more endpoints
   - Requirement completed: Endpoints have been created for each element of data stored in the dataset to perform its functionality.
   - Endpoints are structured consistently and follow RESTful design principles.
- Each endpoint and other functions having unit testing
   - Requirement completed: All endpoints have been tested to ensure reliability and correctness of this project.
- Each endpoint are documented for Swagger
   - Requirement completed: Provided clear documentation for future understanding and client applications.
   - Documentation includes request schemas, response formats, parameters, and HTTP status codes to support client usage.
- When practical, data should be cached in RAM
   -  Requirement completed: Optimize the performance for frequently accessed data.
- Deploy the project to the cloud using CI/CD
   - Requirement partially met: Initial deployment pipeline has been set up.
   - Encountered challenges connecting the API server to the cloud environment.
   - Fixes have been attempted, but additional configuration and testing are required to ensure a stable production deployment.


## Goals for Semester
Backend Goals
- Stabilize Cloud Development 
    - Resolve remaining configuration and connectivity issues.
    - Fully deploy the API server to a cloud-hosted environment.
- Maintain Code Quality 
    - Continue expanding unit test coverage.
    - Refactor backend code for readability and maintainability as the project grows.

Frontend Goals 
- UI–API Integration
    - Connect a frontend or client interface to the existing API endpoints.
    - Validate that data is accurately retrieved, displayed, and updated through the UI.
- Usability Testing
    - Conduct basic usability testing to identify confusing workflows or missing features.
    - Use feedback to refine UI behavior and endpoint usage.
